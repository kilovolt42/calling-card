# Calling Card

That awkward moment when you realize you forgot to email that developer you met last week. You can't remember their email address, or even their name for that matter.

**Calling Card** won't help you find the scrap of paper you jotted that email address down on (that's gone forever). But Calling Card is here to help you next time you meet someone. Rather than stuffing a crumpled piece of paper in your pocket, use Calling Card to send them an email _right then_.

## How It Works

> **You:** _It's been great talking to you. Can I email you so we can get coffee sometime? I wouldn't want to lose touch._  
> **Them:** _Sure, let me scribble my complicated email address on this crumpled piece of paper..._  
> **You:** _No wait! Just tell me your email address now and I can send you a message now with my information using Calling Card!_  
> **Them:** _Oh wow! That's a marvelous idea. You must be really smart. In fact, you look even more attractive now for some reason. My email address is..._

And there you have it. Next week you can get coffee with that developer, hire them to build your super awesome idea, grow rich, and best of all you don't have a crumpled piece of paper uncomfortably crammed in your tight designer jeans.
